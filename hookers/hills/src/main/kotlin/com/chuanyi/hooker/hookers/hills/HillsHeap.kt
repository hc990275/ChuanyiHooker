/**
 * Finds the two Dart-side constants this hooker has to rewrite, by scanning the
 * live heap for their *shape* rather than for a value baked in at build time.
 *
 * Neither of them is reachable any other way. Both live in
 * `_kDartIsolateSnapshotData`, get deserialized into the heap at isolate start,
 * and belong to an `--obfuscate`d build where no name survives. Writing the
 * literals into the module works exactly until the app ships a new endpoint or
 * rotates its key — and the failure is silent, because a needle that matches
 * nothing is indistinguishable from a scan that ran too early.
 *
 * What is searched for instead cannot change without changing what the strings
 * *are*: a URL still starts with `https://`, a PEM still starts with
 * `-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----`. [NativeHook.findAscii] returns the whole run
 * from there to the first non-text byte, which on a Dart target is the exact end
 * of the string — the following cluster's length marker is `(len<<1)|0x80`, so
 * its top bit is always set.
 *
 * Both results are memoised: the scan walks every anonymous mapping in the
 * process, and these values do not change once the isolate is up.
