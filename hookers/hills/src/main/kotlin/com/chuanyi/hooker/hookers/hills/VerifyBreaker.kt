/**
 * Redirects the purchase-verification call and takes over the key its answer is
 * validated with, both inside the live Dart heap.
 *
 * The observed failure mode is that the unlock takes, then reverts about a
 * second later: the grant comes from the local purchase list, the revocation
 * from the server's verdict on a token Google never issued. Measured on device,
 * the request goes out six milliseconds after the purchase is announced.
 *
 * The rewrite is inherently a race: the app connects its billing client, queries
 * its purchases and posts the first verification some thirty milliseconds later,
 * while a full scan of the process's mappings takes a few hundred. It only ever
 * decides once, so losing that race means losing outright. [awaitReady] is how
 * the billing hooks hold the purchase list back until this has landed.
 *
 * Pointing the URL at a dead port does not help — a request that throws reads to
 * the app as "could not verify", which revokes exactly like a negative verdict
 * does. The replacement therefore has to be something that answers; that is
 * [VerifyServer]. Its answer is only believed if it carries the right RS256
 * signature, hence the second swap.
 *
 * Blocking the host instead is not an option either — the same host serves
 * `check-update`, and the app will not start without it. Only a URL swap has the
 * granularity to cut this single path.
 *
 * Both strings live in `_kDartIsolateSnapshotData`, a serialized cluster stream
 * (payloads carry a `(len<<1)|0x80` length marker, not an object header) that is
 * deserialized into the heap at isolate start. Patching the mapped `.so` at
 * runtime is therefore useless; patching the heap copy works, and because each
 * replacement is the same length as what it replaces it never touches the length
 * marker — no object-pool walk, no code offset, unaffected by `--obfuscate`.
 *
 * Neither value is known ahead of time. [HillsHeap] finds them by shape on the
 * same pass, which is also why discovery lives inside the retry ladder rather
 * than before it: until the isolate has deserialized, there is nothing to find.
