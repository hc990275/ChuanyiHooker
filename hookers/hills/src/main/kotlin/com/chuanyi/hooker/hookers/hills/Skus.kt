/**
 * Which product id stands for the lifetime unlock, learned from the app rather
 * than written down.
 *
 * The id is a Dart-side constant: it is not in the dex at all (`hills.pro` gets
 * zero hits there), it is not derivable from the package name, and on an
 * `--obfuscate`d build there is no symbol pointing at it. Hard-coding one means
 * the injection silently stops working the day the app renames its catalogue —
 * the synthetic purchase is still built, still handed to Dart, and simply does
 * not match anything.
 *
 * What the app cannot hide is which products it asks Play about. Every path goes
 * through pigeon:
 *
 * ```
 * queryProductDetailsAsync(List<PlatformQueryProduct>, Result<…>)
 * launchBillingFlow(PlatformBillingFlowParams, VoidResult)
 * ```
 *
 * and both carry the id in plain Java. Reading them there needs no class name of
 * the app's own and no offset.
 *
 * Timing is the one catch: an app usually queries its *purchases* at startup and
 * its *products* only when a store screen opens, so on a very first run the id
 * can arrive after the purchase list has already gone past. Two things cover
 * that — the value is cached per version in the target's own data dir, so it is
 * there from the start on every later launch, and [onLearned] lets the announce
 * path push the purchase the moment the id turns up.
