/**
 * Locates the Java classes this hooker hooks, by what they *do* rather than by
 * what they are called.
 *
 * On the build this was written against every one of them still has its real
 * name — the Flutter plugins ship their own keep rules and the app does not
 * obfuscate its models. That is luck, not a guarantee, and it is the kind of
 * luck that runs out in a point release: R8 renames a class, `Class.forName`
 * returns null, and the feature reports "not found" with nothing to go on.
 *
 * What cannot be renamed is a pigeon channel name. Dart and Java both hold the
 * same literal — `dev.flutter.pigeon.<plugin>.<Api>.<method>` — and the two
 * sides only talk if the strings match exactly, so R8 has to leave them alone.
 * Everything below hangs off one of those:
 *
 * ```
 *   "…in_app_purchase_android.InAppPurchaseApi.queryPurchasesAsync"
 *        -> Messages$InAppPurchaseApi        (the class holding the string)
 *        -> Messages                          (its enclosing name)
 *        -> MethodCallHandlerImpl             (the only implementor)
 *        -> Translator                        (same package, static List->List)
 *
 *   "…shared_preferences_android.SharedPreferencesAsyncApi.setBool"
 *        -> SharedPreferencesAsyncApi -> SharedPreferencesBackend
 * ```
 *
 * The app's own `PlayerConfig` has no channel to hang off, but it is a Moshi
 * `@JsonClass`, and a generated adapter has to spell out every JSON key as a
 * string constant — `isPro` among them. Those are as unrenameable as a channel
 * name for the same reason: they are what the wire format *is*.
 *
 * Four levels, first hit wins:
 *
 *  1. a `dex.<key>` setting — fixes a wrong answer without a rebuild
 *  2. this process's answer, from the cache or an earlier scan
 *  3. the name as of the build this was written against, **if it still resolves**
 *  4. one DexKit pass over the APK
 *
 * The order of the last two is deliberate and is the opposite of what
 * [AstraFlowDex][com.chuanyi.hooker.hookers.astraflow] needs. There the target's
 * class is renamed on every build, so scanning is the normal path. Here nothing
 * is renamed yet, and a pass costs a few hundred milliseconds on the app's
 * startup path — spending that to confirm an answer a single `Class.forName`
 * already gave is pure loss. Trying the known name first means the scan is
 * dormant insurance: it runs only once a name has actually stopped resolving,
 * which is exactly when it is worth what it costs.
 *
 * A stale name cannot win by accident either. Level 3 is not "the name is
 * plausible", it is "a class by that name exists in this process", and after a
 * rename nothing answers to the old one.
