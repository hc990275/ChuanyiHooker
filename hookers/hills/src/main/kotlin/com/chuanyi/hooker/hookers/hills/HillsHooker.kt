/**
 * Hills (`com.mountains.hills`) — a Flutter Emby/Jellyfin client.
 *
 * Pro is decided in Dart, in an `--obfuscate`d `libapp.so`, so none of it is
 * reachable by name. Billing however has to cross into Java: the
 * `in_app_purchase_android` plugin converts Play's purchases to a pigeon payload,
 * and `Translator.fromPurchasesList` is the single funnel every path goes
 * through — `queryPurchasesAsync` and the `onPurchasesUpdated` callback alike.
 *
 * That is enough to make the app believe the lifetime product is owned, but not
 * enough to keep it: the app posts the token to its own backend and revokes on a
 * negative verdict, over rhttp/reqwest which Java never sees. [VerifyBreaker]
 * redirects that one request into [VerifyServer], which answers it in-process —
 * the only part of this that needs native code.

     * answered by the feature being switched on at all. Which feature was asked
     * about is logged rather than filtered, so a build that gates something else
