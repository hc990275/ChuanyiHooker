"""Finding and rewriting string literals inside a Dart AOT snapshot.

`libapp.so` carries `_kDartIsolateSnapshotData`, which is a *serialized cluster
stream* rather than a heap image: a string payload is preceded by a
`(len<<1)|0x80` varint length marker instead of an object header. Two things
follow, and the whole static patch rests on them:

  * patching the file works — the isolate deserializes whatever bytes are there
    at startup, so unlike a running process there is no second copy to chase;
  * an equal-length overwrite never touches the length marker, so no offset, no
    object-pool walk, and `--obfuscate` is irrelevant.

Boundaries are exact here, unlike in the heap. The byte after a payload is the
next cluster's length marker and always has its top bit set, so a run of
printable ASCII ends precisely where the string does.
